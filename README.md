## Description

This repo was created to improve my OpenCV experience. In this repo i will commit a small project sperate on directory.
Probably all of directory will have own README with theroy and how functions is implemented in code.
To use this repo you should have a small knownledge in image processing. For example with
morphology operation. I suppose this repo will not be a "rocket science", so dont wory about it :D

<a name="tech"></a>
## Technology

[Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/) - to run my py scripts<br />
[OpenCV-2](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) - to make operaction with vision<br />
[AruCo Markers generator](https://chev.me/arucogen/) - to get knownledge how AruCo markers working<br />

<a name="syl"></a>
## Sylabus
Get knownledge of:
1. Load image to var
2. Capture frame from camera
3. Binarization image
4. Morphology operation(erode, dilate, open, close)
5. Counting object on image
6. Get contures of object
7. Get center of the object
8. Aruco and my own markers

## Results

All of the folders in this repo should have his own README.
In README you will see:
1. Description of the project
2. How it works(include theory step by step)
3. Results(gif/viedo)

Money conting - is project which will show how to counting coins working<br />
Finding tag - is project which will show how to use/detect own markers<br />
AruCo marker - is project which will show how to use/detect aruCo markers<br />
